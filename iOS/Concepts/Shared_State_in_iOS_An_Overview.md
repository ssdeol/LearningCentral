# Shared State in iOS: An Overview

## **Introduction**

In iOS development, managing state is crucial for creating responsive and dynamic applications. Shared state refers to data that needs to be accessible and modifiable across different parts of an app. Efficient state management ensures a seamless user experience and helps maintain code organization and readability.

## **What is Shared State?**

Shared state is data or information that multiple parts of an application need to access and modify. Examples include user authentication status, user profile information, and data fetched from a server like posts or comments in a Reddit clone app.

## **Ways to Manage Shared State in iOS**

### **1. Singleton Pattern**

**Usage**

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In iOS, this is commonly used to manage shared data like user sessions, configurations, or app-wide services.

**Example**

```swift
class Session: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = Session() // Singleton instance
    
    @Published var currentUser: User?
    @Published var isAuthenticated: Bool = false
    @Published var posts: [Post] = []
    
    private init() {}
    
    func login(user: User) {
        self.currentUser = user
        self.isAuthenticated = true
    }
    
    func logout() {
        self.currentUser = nil
        self.isAuthenticated = false
        self.posts = []
    }
    
    func fetchPosts() {
        APIService.shared.getPosts { [weak self] result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let posts):
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self?.posts = posts
                }
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Error fetching posts: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Advantages**

- Simple to implement and use.
- Provides a global access point for shared state.
- Ensures a single instance, preventing conflicts.

**Disadvantages**

- Can lead to tight coupling and reduced modularity.
- Difficult to test due to global state management.
- Not suitable for complex state dependencies or large-scale apps.

### **2. EnvironmentObject in SwiftUI**

**Usage**

EnvironmentObject is a property wrapper provided by SwiftUI that allows you to inject shared state into the view hierarchy. Itâ€™s particularly useful for propagating state changes across multiple views.

**Example**

1.	**Define the Environment Object:**

```swift
class Session: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentUser: User?
    @Published var isAuthenticated: Bool = false
    @Published var posts: [Post] = []
    
    func login(user: User) {
        self.currentUser = user
        self.isAuthenticated = true
    }
    
    func logout() {
        self.currentUser = nil
        self.isAuthenticated = false
        self.posts = []
    }
    
    func fetchPosts() {
        APIService.shared.getPosts { [weak self] result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let posts):
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self?.posts = posts
                }
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Error fetching posts: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2.	**Inject the Environment Object:**

```swift
@main
struct RedditCloneApp: App {
    @StateObject private var session = Session()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environmentObject(session)
        }
    }
}
```

3.	**Use the Environment Object in Views:**

```swift
struct PostListView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var session: Session
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(session.posts) { post in
                NavigationLink(destination: PostDetailView(post: post)) {
                    PostRow(post: post)
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Posts")
            .onAppear {
                session.fetchPosts()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Advantages**

- Seamless integration with SwiftUI.
- Automatically updates views when the state changes.
- Reduces the need for passing data through view hierarchies.

**Disadvantages**

- Limited to SwiftUI.
- Can become challenging to manage in very large view hierarchies.
- Debugging can be harder if many views depend on the same EnvironmentObject.

### **3. Combine Framework**

**Usage**

The Combine framework allows you to handle asynchronous data flows and state updates reactively. It is useful for more complex state management scenarios, such as when you need to handle multiple asynchronous data streams.

**Example**

1.	**Define the State and Actions:**

```swift
class AppState: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentUser: User?
    @Published var isAuthenticated: Bool = false
    @Published var posts: [Post] = []
}

enum AppAction {
    case login(User)
    case logout
    case fetchPosts
}

class AppStore: ObservableObject {
    @Published private(set) var state: AppState
    private var cancellables: Set<AnyCancellable> = []
    
    init(state: AppState) {
        self.state = state
    }
    
    func dispatch(action: AppAction) {
        switch action {
        case .login(let user):
            state.currentUser = user
            state.isAuthenticated = true
        case .logout:
            state.currentUser = nil
            state.isAuthenticated = false
            state.posts = []
        case .fetchPosts:
            APIService.shared.getPosts { [weak self] result in
                switch result {
                case .success(let posts):
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        self?.state.posts = posts
                    }
                case .failure(let error):
                    print("Error fetching posts: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2.	**Inject and Use the Store in Views:**

```swift
@main
struct RedditCloneApp: App {
    @StateObject private var store = AppStore(state: AppState())
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environmentObject(store)
        }
    }
}

struct PostListView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var store: AppStore
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(store.state.posts) { post in
                NavigationLink(destination: PostDetailView(post: post)) {
                    PostRow(post: post)
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Posts")
            .onAppear {
                store.dispatch(action: .fetchPosts)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Advantages**

- Powerful and flexible for handling complex state dependencies.
- Reactive programming model suits asynchronous data flows.
- Fine-grained control over state changes and their propagation.

**Disadvantages**

- Higher complexity and learning curve.
- Requires more boilerplate code.
- Not as straightforward as other methods for simple use cases.

## **Conclusion**

Choosing the right method for managing shared state in your iOS app depends on the complexity of your application and your specific needs:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Best for simple applications where a global state is sufficient.
- **EnvironmentObject**: Ideal for SwiftUI applications with moderate complexity, providing an easy way to propagate state.
- **Combine Framework**: Suitable for complex applications with multiple asynchronous data streams and advanced state management needs.
